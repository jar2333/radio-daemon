# Icecast radio source daemon

WARNING: this code is not yet plug and play. One cannot simply clone the repository and run it. It is here for documentation purposes.

Everything available to use this is in the repository, but one must have `ffmpeg`, `ices`, and `icecast2` installed. IceS can be built from source, get the source tarball here: https://icecast.org/ices/

All python dependencies can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. A virtual env is recommended.

Documentation for the `user_config.xml` file:

The `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` is called the "xml preamble". It just specifies information used in parsing xml files.

The xml root element is `<config>`. The child elements of the root must be `<timeslot>` elements. It can have any number (0 or more) of `<timeslot>` children, each defining a separate time slot for the stream.

A `<timeslot>` element must have 4 children (otherwise parsing will fail):
- `<genre>` element. It encloses a string which describes the time slot's genre of music.
- `<time>` element. It must contain one `<start>` and one `<end>` child elements. These both must enclose a string representing a time in HH:MM format (24 hour time). These strings represent the start and end of the time slot, respectively.
- `<albums>` element. It encloses a string representing the path to the directory which will be searched to find albums. An album is just a folder inside this directory, which contains music files and a cover image.
- `<blacklist>` element. It can contain 0 or more children `<album>` elements, each enclosing a string representing the name of an album folder. Every folder named in this blacklist will be skipped when loading albums.
